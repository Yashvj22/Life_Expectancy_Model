# 🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction Model

This project predicts **Life Expectancy** based on various socio-economic and health-related factors. The model is built using **Machine Learning** techniques and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit app**.

##  Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding key factors affecting life expectancy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and transformation.
- **Model Building**: Implemented multiple regression models with **hyperparameter tuning**.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Used RMSE, R² Score, and MAE to evaluate model performance.
- **Interactive Streamlit App**: Users can input data and get real-time predictions.

##  How to Use

1. Open the **Streamlit App** (link below).
2. Enter the required input features.
3. Click **Predict** to see the estimated **Life Expectancy**.

##  Dataset
The dataset contains features like:
- **GDP, Alcohol Consumption, Schooling, Immunization Coverage, Mortality Rate, BMI**, etc.
- The **target variable** is **Life Expectancy (in years).**
